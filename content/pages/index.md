## Why Choose a Static Site?

Static sites are making a comeback for good reasons. They're fast, secure, and simple to maintain. Perfect for blogs, portfolios, and business websites that don't need complex server-side processing.

With static sites, you get:

- **Lightning-fast loading times** - Pre-rendered HTML means no waiting for database queries
- **Enhanced security** - No database means fewer attack vectors
- **Lower hosting costs** - Static sites can be hosted almost anywhere at minimal cost
- **Great SEO** - Search engines love fast-loading, semantic HTML content
