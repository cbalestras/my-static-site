# Getting Started with Static Sites

Static sites are making a comeback, and for good reason. They're fast, secure, and simple to deploy.

## What is a Static Site?

A static site consists of pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served directly to the browser without any server-side processing.

## Benefits of Static Sites

### Speed

Static sites load incredibly fast because there's no database queries or server-side rendering.

### Security

With no database or server-side code, there are fewer security vulnerabilities to worry about.

### Simplicity

Static sites are easier to develop, maintain, and deploy compared to dynamic sites.

## Getting Started

To create your own static site, you'll need:

1. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. A static site generator (optional)
3. A hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel

## Conclusion

Static sites are perfect for blogs, portfolios, and small business websites. Give them a try for your next project!
